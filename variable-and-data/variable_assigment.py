# We can assign or manipulate numbers variable

myNumber = 10  # as usual, initiate a variable
print(myNumber)  # make sure of it, even tho we didn't have to

myNumber += 5  # add some assignment
print(myNumber)  # now see it yourself

myBool = True  # you know you can assign boolean also
myBool ^= True  # XOR it with false
print(myBool)  # now see it
